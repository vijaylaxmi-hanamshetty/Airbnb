              <p>
                To become a Co-Host, you must be invited by a Host. Hosts can
                invite friends, family members, neighbors, or others they trust to
                help them manage their listings and guests.

              <p>
                Yes, Co-Hosts can charge for their services. The fee structure and
                payment terms should be agreed upon between the Host and the
                Co-Host. It can be a percentage of the booking fee or a fixed
                amount per booking.
